Version 2.0.0, 2023-02-07

	BREAKING CHANGES:

	* Added a reverse-complement flag to prepareTrainingData.py. If this is	set
	to true, then you must specify strand mappings to each of the heads in
	that file. If you want your code to behave like before, just set
	"reverse-complement" to false in the json file for prepareTrainingData.py.

	ENHANCEMENTS:
	* Reverse complement support added, see overview.tex in the section on
	prepareTrainingData.py. (Charles McAnany)

	BUG FIXES:
	* none

	CONTRIBUTORS:
	Charles McAnany. 

PREVIOUS VERSIONS:
	Versions of BPReveal before 2.0.0 are not recorded here, but the software
	would not have been completed without help from Julia Zeitlinger, Anshul
	Kundaje, and Melanie Weilert.
