Version 3.5.0, 2023-10-17
	BREAKING CHANGES
	* This should not have any effects on typical uses, but BPReveal now uses
	Python 3.11.
	* Removed the compiled jaccard library, the install process now
	automatically builds it. You'll need to re-install BPReveal (or run make
	in the src directory).

	NEW FEATURES:
	* Created a directory of helpful tools under src/tools. These are not part
	of BPReveal proper, but have some useful goodies for plotting and stuff.
	Pull requests welcome for new tools!
	* Added the ability to provide sequence fasta files to interpretFlat.py
	this required a total rewrite of the interpretation code to use streaming.
	interpretFlat now requires just a few gigs of memory. It also calculates
	profile and counts contribution simultaneously, leading to a 60% speedup.
	* Created better conda integration. The BPReveal libraries should be on
	your python path when you open python, and they are in the bpreveal
	package. You can now `import bpreveal.utils` from any python interpreter.
	Also created a bin/ directory that has links to all of the BPReveal
	scripts. You should be able to just run `trainSoloModel config.json` once
	you've activated the conda environment.

	ENHANCEMENTS:
	* Switched to storing importance scores as 16-bit floating point values
	and enabled hdf5 compression, leading to an 80% reduction in the size of
	contribution hdf5 files. Upgraded several components to effectively read
	and write in a compressed, block-oriented format.
	* Added type annotations to most of the library functions, allowing your
	editor to quickly check for mistakes in argument order and type.
	* Added type definitions to utils.py, so the code now (mostly) uses
	consintent definitions for variable types.
	* Updated the build scripts and added one for building a local copy of the
	BPReveal environment.

Version 3.4.0, 2023-10-06
	NEW FEATURES:
	* CWM scanning is now implemented. This takes the output from modisco and
	uses contribution scores to look for motif instances across the genome.
	The documentation has been updated. Thanks to Melanie Weilert for an
	initial BPReveal-compatible implementation of CWM scanning.

Version 3.3.2, 2023-09-19
	BUG FIXES:
	* Updated the conda install script to be compatible with Tensorflow 2.12.
	The tensorflow-probability package that had been installed was too old, so
	I have changed to getting tensorflow and tensorflow-probability from conda.
	The build script also installs mamba, which seemed to work better for me.

Version 3.3.1, 2023-08-30
	ENHANCEMENTS:
	* Added a "heads" section to prepareBed.py json files. This lets you
	combined multiple bigwigs just as you do for the final model. The old
	"bigwigs" section is now deprecated, and will be removed in BPReveal 5.0.
	Previously, if you had a two-task head, prepareBed.py would reject any
	region where *either* of those tasks was outside of your counts limits.
	The new version adds the bigwigs in each head together before doing the
	counts culling. This is useful when one track has zero reads but the other
	still has data.
	Thanks to Melanie for suggesting this feature.
	* Finally ran through shap.py and fixed formatting. 
	* Added two features to metrics.py. First, for regions that are empty,
	metrics.py now has a feature to simply ignore those regions rather than
	using them in counts correlations (they were always ignored in profile
	correlations). Second, added a feature to generate json output for ease of
	parsing. 
	* Added three utility functions to gaOptimize.py for easily converting
	lists of corruptors to and from strings and numerical arrays. 
	Thanks to Haining Jiang for suggesting these. 

	DEPRECATIONS:
	* The "bigwigs" section in prepareBed.py json files has been deprecated
	and will become an error in BPReveal 5.0.

	Melanie Weilert, Charles McAnany.


Version 3.3.0, 2023-06-23
	NEW FEATURES:
	* Added a genetic algorithm module. See the demo pdfs for how to use them. 
	* Added a batch-running tool to utils.py, this lets you run many sequences
	through your model without worrying about constructing batches
	efficiently. 

	ENHANCEMENTS:
	* Rewrote makePredictionsFasta to stream data in and out. It is now quite
	fast and uses very little memory. 
	* Updated the OSKN demo python notebook to be compatible with version 3.

Version 3.2.0, 2023-05-17
	NEW FEATURES:
	* Previously, if a solo model had a different input length than the
	residual model, you could not combine them. Melanie added logic so that if
	the solo model has a smaller input length (for example, because it has
	fewer layers), the sequence will automatically be cropped down to match
	it. In this way, you don't have to match solo and residual architectures
	any more. 

	ENHANCEMENTS:
	* Further re-formatting to comply with PEP8. 

	CONTRIBUTORS:
	Melanie Weilert (cropdown logic), Charles McAnany (code cleanup)

Version 3.1.0, 2023-05-14
	NEW FEATURES:
	* Added an automatic reverse complement strand selection feature. Instead
	of saying '"revcomp-task-order" : [1,0]', you can now say
	'"revcomp-task-order":"auto"' when you have one or two tasks in a head.

	ENHANCEMENTS:
	* Code cleanup in general, such as removing unused imports and tidying up
	formatting.

	BUG FIXES:
	* Fixed a missing import in prepareBed.py that broke the regex mode. 

	CONTRIBUTORS:
	Charles McAnany


Version 3.0.1, 2023-04-26
	ENHANCEMENTS:
	* Formatted the code throughout the repository to more closely comply with
	PEP8.

	BUG FIXES:
	* Fixed a bug in argument order for deduplicating in prepareBed.py

	CONTRIBUTORS:
	Charles McAnany

Version 3.0.0, 2023-03-10
	BREAKING CHANGES:
	* There is a new "remove-overlaps" field that is mandatory in
	prepareBed.py json files. If set to true, then you can set how close two
	peaks must be before they are considered overlapping. (Thanks to Melanie
	Weilert for the implementation.)
	* On discussion with Melanie, it occurred that the cropdown feature of the
	transformation model is never appropriate. Therefore, this feature has
	been removed.  Instead, in a future version, there will be a feature to 
	crop down the input sequence to the solo model during training the
	combined model. (Charles McAnany) 
	* Since there is no cropping, it was silly to call the input-length
	"sequence-input-length" inside the transformation config json. It is now
	sensibly called "input-length". 

	ENHANCEMENTS:
	* The PISA code was totally rewritten; it now uses a streaming 
	architecture so that loading the data, calculating shap scores, and saving
	data are done by different threads. This cuts way down on memory use, and
	makes it possible to run pisa over an entire genome. (generating 100 GiB
	per megabase or so.) (Charles McAnany)

	BUG FIXES:
	* In the combined config, the documentation called a parameter
	"output-directory", but the code expected "output-prefix". The
	documentation has been corrected. (Charles McAnany)


	CONTRIBUTORS:
	Melanie Weilert, Charles McAnany. 

Version 2.0.2, 2023-02-17
	ENHANCEMENTS:
	* interpretPisaBed.py will now include predictions and reference
	predictions in the output hdf5.

	CONTRIBUTORS:
	Charles McAnany

Version 2.0.1, 2023-02-09
	ENHANCEMENTS:
	* prepareBed.py will no longer replace the names in your bed files; the
	generated files will have the same names as the input beds. (Suggested by
	Melanie)

	CONTRIBUTORS:
	Melanie Weilert, Charles McAnany


Version 2.0.0, 2023-02-07

	BREAKING CHANGES:

	* Added a reverse-complement flag to prepareTrainingData.py. If this is	set
	to true, then you must specify strand mappings to each of the heads in
	that file. If you want your code to behave like before, just set
	"reverse-complement" to false in the json file for prepareTrainingData.py.

	ENHANCEMENTS:
	* Reverse complement support added, see overview.tex in the section on
	prepareTrainingData.py. (Charles McAnany)

	BUG FIXES:
	* none

PREVIOUS VERSIONS:
	Versions of BPReveal before 2.0.0 are not recorded here, but the software
	would not have been completed without help from Julia Zeitlinger, Anshul
	Kundaje, and Melanie Weilert.
