BPReveal is a suite of tools for working with sequence-to-profile models in the vein of
BPNet.

It incorporates bias correction in the style of chrombpnet-lite, but with added features
to regress out very complex biases.

It also incorporates a new interpretation tool, called PISA (Pairwise
Interaction Shap Analysis) that lets you view a two-dimensional map of cause
and effect over a region.
