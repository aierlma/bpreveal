BPReveal is an expansion of the chrombpnet-lite repository, designed to allow
for more flexibility.
It also incorporates a new interpretation tool, called PISA (Pairwise
Interaction Shap Analysis) that lets you view a two-dimensional map of cause
and effect over a region.
The two main changes are the addition of multi-task models, and a
generalization of the regression step.
