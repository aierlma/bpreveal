This constant sets the number of entries in each chunk that gets compressed.
For good performance, whenever you read a compressed hdf5 file, it really helps

In parallel code, if something goes wrong, a queue could stay stuck forever.
Python's queues have a nifty timeout parameter so that they'll crash if they
wait too long. If a queue has been blocking for longer than this timeout, have
the program crash.

This is measured in seconds.

This gets set to True if you use any of the tensorflow-importing functions in

the easyÂ® functions and the threaded batcher check to see if Tensorflow has
been loaded in the parent process before they spawn children.
